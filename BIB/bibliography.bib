 abstract = {[Since hedge funds specify significant lock-up periods, we investigate persistence in the performance of hedge funds using a multi-period framework in which the likelihood of observing persistence by chance is lower than in the traditional two-period framework. Under the null hypothesis of no manager skill (no persistence), the theoretical distribution of observing wins or losses follows a binomial distribution. We test this hypothesis using the traditional two-period framework and compare the findings with the results obtained using our multi-period framework. We examine whether persistence is sensitive to the length of return measurement intervals by using quarterly, half-yearly and yearly returns. We find maximum persistence at the quarterly horizon indicating that persistence among hedge fund managers is short term in nature.]},

@article{AldorNoiman.2013,
 abstract = {Many statistical procedures assume that the underlying data-generating process involves Gaussian errors. Among the popular tests for normality, only the Kolmogorov?Smirnov test has a graphical representation. Alternative tests, such as the Shapiro?Wilk test, offer little insight as to how the observed data deviate from normality. In this article, we discuss a simple new graphical procedure which provides simultaneous confidence bands for a normal quantile?quantile plot. These bands define a test of normality and are narrower in the tails than those related to the Kolmogorov?Smirnov test. Correspondingly, the new procedure has greater power to detect deviations from normality in the tails. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

@article{Amenc.2003,
 abstract = {That hedge funds start gaining wide acceptance while they still remain a somewhat mysterious asset class enhances the need for a better measurement of their performance. This paper is an attempt to provide a unified picture of hedge fund managers{\&}{\#}39; ability to generate abnormal returns. To alleviate the concern over model risk, we consider an extensive set of models for assessing the risk-adjusted performance of hedge fund managers. We conclude that hedge funds appear to have significantly positive alphas when normal returns are measured by an explicit factor model, even when multiple factors serving as proxies for credit or liquidity risks are accounted for. However, hedge funds on average do not have significantly positive alphas once the entire distribution is considered or implicit factors are included. While we find significantly positive alphas for a subset of hedge funds across all possible models, our main contribution is perhaps to show that (i) different models strongly disagree on the absolute risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds as evidenced by a very large dispersion of alphas across models and yet (ii) they largely agree on hedge funds{\&}{\#}39;relative performance in the sense that they tend to rank order the funds in the same way. * The author for correspondence is Lionel Martellini.

Hedge fund leverage is counter-cyclical to the leverage of listed financial intermediaries and decreases prior to the start of the financial crisis in mid-2007.

Importantly, within this direct-sold segment, we find no evidence that actively managed funds underperform index funds.

It was discovered that beta had a positive effect on performance, while the increasing age of a fund caused managers to suffer from `style drift', thereby reducing the hedge fund's performance. It was also found that registration increased returns by 11.6 per cent by raising the net worth requirement for accredited investors, thereby providing funds with a more knowledgeable investor and increased asset base stability. This suggests that advisers have been able to use funds more efficiently by taking on more leveraged positions and holding less cash on hand, while pursuing a greater number of strategies.},

For diversified hedge fund portfolios (as proxied by indexes of hedge funds and funds of hedge funds), the seven ABS factors can explain up to 80 percent of monthly return variations. Because ABS factors are directly observable from market prices, this model provides a standardized framework for identifying differences among major hedge fund indexes that is free of the biases inherent in hedge fund databases.},

@misc{Joenvaara.2012,
 abstract = {This paper presents new stylized facts about hedge fund performance and database selection biases based on a novel database aggregation. By highlighting economically important effects of database selection bias on previously documented results we aim to improve the ability of researchers in this literature to compare results across different studies. We carefully motivate and test a set of eight hypotheses regarding the impact of database selection biases on stylized facts. We document significant positive risk-adjusted performance of the average fund while differences in its magnitude are due to differences in fund size, domicile and data biases, but not differences in fund risk exposures. Measures of misreporting and return smoothing by funds are similar across different databases. Performance persistence results are sensitive to share restrictions, rebalancing frequency, fund size and weighting scheme as well as more pronounced biases in certain databases. Hedge funds with greater managerial incentives, smaller funds and younger funds outperform while multivariate analysis shows that funds imposing lockups do not deliver significantly higher risk-adjusted returns. Several stylized facts are sensitive to the choice of the database which highlights the importance of using a consolidated database that is more representative of the aggregate industry.

@article{Liang.1999,
 abstract = {Empirical evidence indicates that hedge funds differ substantially from traditional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds follow dynamic trading strategies and have low systematic risk. Hedge funds' special fee structures apparently align managers' incentives with fund performance. Funds with ?high watermarks? (under which managers are required to make up previous losses before receiving any incentive fees) significantly outperform those without. Hedge funds provide higher Sharpe ratios than mutual funds, and their performance in the period of January 1992 through December 1996 reflects better manager skills, although hedge fund returns are more volatile. Average hedge fund returns are related positively to incentive fees, fund assets, and the lockup period.},

In this part, the authors concentrate on reviewing some of the micro (e.g., fund level) elements driving fund performance. Specifically, they analyze the impact of fund characteristics such as survivor bias, age, and size on the fund's performance. In some cases, the results presented in this article seem to question previous results such as the impact of stale prices on return relationships, survivor bias, the use of historical hedge fund index data, and incentive fees. In other cases, the results support previous research on issues such as performance persistence, lock-ups, and a number of other micro/fund effects.},

For performance persistence, we present some pioneering studies that contradict previous findings that hedge funds' performance is a short term matter. We discuss recent innovative studies that examine the size, age, performance fees and other factors to give a 360° view of hedge funds' performance attribution. Small funds, younger funds and funds with high performance fees all outperform the opposite. Long lockup period funds tend to outperform short lockups and domiciled funds tend to outperform offshore funds. This is the first survey of recent innovative and challenging studies into hedge funds' performance attribution, and it should be particularly useful to investors trying to choose between hedge funds.},

We use exogenous break points and a switching Markov model to endogenously determine different market conditions. We find that HFs deliver positive alpha only during ``good'' times, irrespective of their fundamentals. During ``bad'' times, they minimise their systematic risk. Small and young funds, and those with redemption restrictions deliver higher alpha compared to their peers during ``good'' times. Finally, specific strategies deliver significantly negative alpha during ``bad'' times.},
