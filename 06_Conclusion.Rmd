This thesis tries to answer the question under which circumstances and how often households update their inflation expectations. As shown with the help of aggregated and micro data from the SCE expectations have changed significantly over the last two years. Microdata show a spike in updating share and updating behavior at the beginning of 2020. By combining survey data with data from GoogleTrends it is possible to highlight the role of searching behavior as a channel for updating expectations.
Due to the lack of available microdata all analyses for microdata provide only limited explanations for the changes in the last twelve months. All analyses are influenced by limitations through panel conditioning who are unable to match with the limited extent of this thesis. With access to more recent microdata and more sound analyses regarding the underlying limitations of survey data future research can fill this void and provide a more satisfying answer to these important questions.
