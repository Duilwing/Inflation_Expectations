This thesis tried to answer the question under which circumstances and how often households update their inflation expectations. As shown with the help of aggregated data, expectations in general have changed significantly over the last two years. Expectations differ between age groups, education and income levels in their average estimation and distribution. Especially age cohorts show a characteristic relationship between age and expectations.
By combining survey data with data from GoogleTrends it was possible to highlight the role of searching behavior as a channel for updating expectations. It was possible to visually highlight the similar pattern for the evolution of aggregated data and GoogleTrends. Searching behavior therefore plays a significant role within the formation of expectations, especially in the last two years. 
Microdata show a spike in the updating share at the beginning of 2020. Unfortunately, a relationship between updating behavior and searching behavior can neither be dismissed nor confirmed without the data for the last 12 months.
All analyses are influenced by limitations through panel conditioning and other frictions who were unable to match due to the limited extent of this thesis. With access to recent microdata and more sound analyses regarding the underlying limitations of survey data future research can fill this void and provide a more satisfying answer to these important questions.
