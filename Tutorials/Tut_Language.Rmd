## Switch from English to German

This template supports theses in German and English. To switch between them, use the `lang` parameter in the yaml header. 
To write in American English (German), use "en-us" ("de"). This affects the name of the table of contents, list of figures, list of tables and the statutory declaration. 
However, this does not change the title of the references, this has to be adapted manually.

## RStudio spell-checking

From RStudio 1.3 upwards, the RStudio IDE offers live spell checking. 
To change it from English to German, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Spelling and change the main dictionary to German. 
Live spelling doesn't work for German (new) just yet, but in most cases, the German dictionary will suffice. 
Make sure to check "use live spell checking" after changing the dictionary. The change will affect the output after you save the document. 
In order to install a full German dictionary for spelling suggestions, follow these steps:

  1. Download the German dictionary files [de_DE_frami.aff](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/de/de_DE_frami.aff) and [de_DE_frami.dic](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/de/de_DE_frami.dic) from the libreoffice repository (free!).
  2. Click [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200551916-Spelling-Dictionaries) to add them to RStudio by copying them into the correct folder. This depends on your operating system, but the explanation on the website is pretty thorough.
