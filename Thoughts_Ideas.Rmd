Thoughts:
- people build their expectations based on past experiences --> explains german inflation debates: everytime inflation goes slighty up we talk about hyperinflation in the twenties
- people have more sensitivity for inflation in rough times, dont look at it in good times
- people in advanced countries dont care, have no clue about inflation/inflation rates, because the dont have to

 
Ideas:
- positive correlation between crises like corona and updating behavior and therefore inflation expectations by looking at survey data and google-trends
- micro regression the other way around
- VaR modelling
- data cleaning(As in @Drager.2017 the upper and lower 2.5% of all values are excluded to control for outliers in the questionnaire. )
