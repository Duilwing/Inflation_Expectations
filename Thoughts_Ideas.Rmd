Thoughts:
- people build their expectations based on past experiences --> explains german inflation debates: everytime inflation goes slighty up we talk about hyperinflation in the twenties
- people have more sensitivity for inflation in rough times, dont look at it in good times
- people in advanced countries dont care, have no clue about inflation/inflation rates, because the dont have to

 
Ideas:
- Google Searches about Inflation as a proxy for expectation formation
- positive correlation between crises like corona and updating behavior and therefore inflation expectations by looking at survey data and google-trends
- looking at anchoring by also looking at longtime expectations, maybe regresseion about trends and growth rates for the expectations
- plotting the correlation between revisions in individualsâ€™ one-year ahead inflation expectations with their revisions in expectations about longer-run inflation(Weber 2021)
- comparison of short and long-term variances
