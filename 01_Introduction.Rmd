Brainard(2022):
- inflation bears high risks
- stable and low inflation key for economy and labor market

Bernanke(2007):
- explains risks of inflation, benefits of low stable inflation
- gives an definition what anchored expectations mean

Research question: 
- Under which circumstances do households/ordinary people update their inflation expectations?
- are infl. expectations still anchored or not?
 
 
from the papers:
- people have more sensitivity for inflation in rough times, dont look at it in good times
- people in advanced countries dont care, have no clue about inflation/inflation rates, because the dont have to
 
Ideas:
- Google Searches about Inflation as a proxy for expectation formation
- positive correlation between crises like corona and updating behavior and therefore inflation expectations by looking at survey data and google-trends
- looking at anchoring by also looking at longtime expectations, maybe regresseion about trends and growth rates for the expectations
- plotting the correlation between revisions in individualsâ€™ one-year ahead inflation expectations with their revisions in expectations about longer-run inflation(Weber 2021)

Thoughts:
people build their expectations based on past experiences --> explains german inflation debates: everytime inflation goes slighty up we talk about hyperinflation in the twenties
