Brainard(2022):
- inflation bears high risks
- stable and low inflation key for economy and labor market


Research question: 
- Under which circumstances do households/ordinary people update their inflation expectations?
 
 
from the papers:
- people have more sensitivity for inflation in rough times, dont look at it in good times
- people in advanced countries dont care, have no clue about inflation/inflation rates, because the dont have to
 
Idea:
- Google Searches about Inflation as a proxy for expectation formation
- positive correlation between crises like corona and updating behavior and therefore inflation expectations by looking at survey data and google-trends

Conclusions:
- in google trends for US: cyclical updating behavior until mid 2021, after that huge increase, co movement with the expectations of inflation
- cyclical updating: increases in spring and around October (black Friday), low interest in the summer and around Christmas/new year
