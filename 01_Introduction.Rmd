Since the last two years inflation has been risen to levels even professional forecasters have never expected (@Powell.2022). This development bears high risks as stable and low inflation rates are a necessity for a healthy economy (@Brainard.2022). Inflation rates play a significant part in determining the economic conditions as @Bernanke.2007 explains in his speech "Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasting". Low inflation coincides with "growth, efficiency, and stability" (@Bernanke.2007, P.2), as high inflation can lead to uncertainty and losses in public confidence (@Bernanke.2007). Another important aspect of inflation are inflation expectations for their influence on economic policy (@Drager.2017) and on the spending behavior of consumers (@Drager.2021). For example in the last two years, particular with the beginning of the Russian assault on Ukraine, inflation expectations of German households did increase and have become more uncertain (@Afunts.2022).

This thesis wants to analyze the formation of inflation expectations and updating behavior of US households with the help of survey data. By combining data from the Survey of Consumers Expectations and GoogleTrends it will be possible to determine under what circumstances households update their knowledge and therefore their short-term expectations.
After a presentation of the literature two hypotheses for the further analysis are formulated. In Chapter 3 a descriptive analysis of the one-year expectations from the last ten years is conducted which also focuses on differences between demographic characteristics like age, education and income. The time series for GoogleTrends is presented in a similar way. 
Following the descriptive analysis computations on the updating behavior with the available micro data are executed. At last regressions show the relationship between expectations and uncertainty, actual inflation, searching behavior and updating behavior.
