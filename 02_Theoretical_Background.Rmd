## Why are Expectations relevant?

@Bernanke.2007 stresses the importance of expectations for actual inflation. This influence works through two channels, the real rate and consumption. As described in the Fisher Equation, the real interest rate depends positively on the nominal interest rate and negatively on the expected inflation (@Blanchard.2010). 
The second channel is explained by the Euler Equation. The Euler Equation is explained by @Drager.2021 as the spending possibilities of a consumer depended on real consumption and expected future consumption, nominal interest rates and expected inflation (@Drager.2021). By using survey data of German households @Drager.2021 find that higher inflation expectations lead to an increase in the likelihood of higher consumption today. @Weber.2021 conclude that expectations about future prices matter today through the influence on current decisions.

## Measuring and Demographic Differences of Inflation Expectations

Expectations can be measured by surveys and the results can be used to monitor public expectations about inflation (@Bernanke.2007). Surveys, especially for the US, exist for different target groups like households or professional financial forecasters(@Coibion.2020). In Chapter 3 surveys in general and particular the survey used for the later analysis will be explained in more detail.

Inflation expectations differ across certain groups, for example households and professionals (@Coibion.2020). Both groups can best be distinguished by their grade of anchoring of inflation expectations(@Coibion.2020). @Bernanke.2007 describes anchoring as achieved, if price shocks impact only short-term expectations, while long-term expectations remain stable. @Carvalho.2021 define long-term expectations as endogenous and heavily influenced by short-term expectations. This aspect of expectations is crucial for Central Banks, as stable long-term expectations impact long-term decisions (@Powell.2022).
In contrast to professionals, @Coibion.2020 state that households are much less anchored. Another distinction between professionals and households is the spread between expected and actual inflation. While professionals have expectations close to the actual inflation households often report upward biased expectations (@DAcunto.2022).

@DAcunto.2022 also mention substantial dispersion between households' beliefs, for example across countries. @Ha.2022 find that expectations in emerging market and developing economies (EMDE) have a higher sensitivity towards shocks and are overall less anchored as in developed countries. Indeed, households in developed countries are "remarkably inattentive to inflation dynamics" (@Coibion.2020, P.2). The main reason for this dynamic lies in the stable inflation rates for most developed countries during the last decades (@DAcunto.2022). @Coibion.2020 credit this rational inattention to the successful monetary policy of central banks. 

Chapter 3 will discuss more demographic differences between inflation expectations that will be presented in more detail in combination of the data presentation. In short, inflation expectations also differ for age, education, income and cognitive capabilities (@Brainard.2022, @Coibion.2020 and @Weber.2021).

## The Importance of Price Signals

Due to rational inattention (@DAcunto.2019) regarding actual inflation households build their expectations through other channels. One important channel to gather information lies in daily shopping and the then perceived prices (@Cavallo.2017). @Weber.2021 name food and gasoline prices as one of the major channels for US households. More frequently purchased goods are weighted higher and introduce further bias into the formation of expectations (@Weber.2021). @DAcunto.2019 also show that the overall frequency of purchases of nun-durable goods positively correlates with inflation expectations. The relative higher volatility of gasoline and food prices could therefore be one reason for the upward biased expectations and the spread between households and professionals (@Corsello.2021). @Coibion.2020 conclude that price signals in form of good purchases are therefore one important channel in the formation of expectations.

## The Importance of Information Signals

As mentioned previously, households in developed economies payed little attention to actual inflation rates and updated their expectations only slowly at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic (@Armantier.2020). But as @Afunts.2022 present, a widened news coverage of inflation in combination with the shocks at the energy market has lead to increasing expectations. With the help of a survey consisting of 145 tenured economics professors in Germany @Drager.2022 find evidence for an increase in expectations for professionals. Both observations are in line with the findings of @Drager.2017 that volatility in inflation leads to the updating of expectations. 

@Weber.2021 state news coverage as one possible factor for the formation of expectations. Information treatments lead to strong responses and therefore adjustments towards actual inflation (@Coibion.2020). But the role and influence of media coverage for the formation of expectations is seen as relative small. @Coibion.2020 see media coverage as only a "relatively force" (P.6) and for @DAcunto.2022 available information did not play a significant role in the past. News about inflation, monetary policy ore statements by a Central Bank effected only informed specialists (@Coibion.2020). @Weber.2021 acknowledge these findings for low inflation environments. Nonetheless in their paper "Imperfect Information and Consumer Inflation Expectations: Evidence from Microdata" @Drager.2017 state that receiving news on inflation increases the probability of updating expectations. In this model with imperfect information, participants in the Michigan Survey of Consumers update their expectations if professional forecasts become more volatile (@Drager.2017).

In conclusion, Coibion et al. write that "economic agents update their beliefs depending on the strengths of their priors and signals" (@Coibion.2020, P.5), which can heavily differentiate in economic environments. With the worsening of economic conditions individuals update their expectations towards the real inflation rate and professional forecasts (@Coibion.2020). Under favorable conditions households act under rational inattention, which leads to the observed upward bias of householdsÂ´ expectations (@Cavallo.2017).

## The Hypotheses

With the theoretical background presented, the following two hypotheses are formulated:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(H_1:\) There is a positive correlation between aggregated inflation expectations and uncertainty, Google searches and the actual inflation.
  \item \(H_2:\) There is a positive correlation between Google searches and updating behavior of individual consumers.
\end{itemize}

The first hypothesis wants to answer if the relationship between rational inattention and economic conditions can be observed by analyzing survey data. If shocks trigger updating behavior it must be possible to observe this effect in the data. By looking at Google searches for inflation this thesis provides a proxy for searching behavior, which will be described in more detail in the next chapter.
The second hypothesis tries to understand the relationship of searching behavior and updating behavior, which will be conducted with the help of available microdata. Combining the results of @Drager.2017 with the time series of Google searches it may be possible to see how individuals update their expectations.
